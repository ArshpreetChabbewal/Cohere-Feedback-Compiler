# Feedback Analysis Tool

Hey! Welcome to a small fun side project I made to test out the Cohere API.

It can be viewed through this link: https://feedback-analyzer-arshpreet-chabbewals-projects.vercel.app

You may use the mock-data.csv file provided for testing purposes.

Most customer review forms have an "Additional Comments" section, that can be lengthy to go through for businesses, this application takes in a set of written reviews in a csv file, summarizes each review, and provides an overall review, highlighting the main points. This makes it far easier, cheaper, and more effiecient to go through valuable feedback, and implement improvements as soon as possible,
